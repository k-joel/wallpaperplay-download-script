# wallpaperplay-download-script
Tired of having to click each download button individually and waiting 5 seconds for the link to generate? This simple python script will mass download every wallpaper available on a page. Just point it to the desired url and it will do the rest.

Usage:
  - `python wpp.py https://wallpaperplay.com/board/4k-hd-wallpapers`


## Getting Started
This script requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run. Once that is installed you will need to run the following command to install the required libraries.
- `pip install bs4, requests, tqdm`
